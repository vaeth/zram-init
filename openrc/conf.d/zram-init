# For each device, specify the following variables
# Omitting them is the same as specifying them as empty: It uses defaults
# type0, type1, ... are the variables for the types (see below)
# size0, size1, ... are the variables for the sizes (in MB)
# mlim0, mlim1, ... are the variables for the maximal uncompressed memory (MB)
# back0, back1, ... are the variables for the backup device (paths)
# icmp0, icmp1, ... are the flags (nonempty = true) whether incompressible
#                   pages are written to the backup device (requires back*)
# idle0, idle1, ... are the flags (nonempty = true) whether idle pages are
#                   written to the backup device (requires back*)
# wlim0, wlim1, ... set the writeback_limit for idle pages (implies idle*)
# algo0, algo1, ... are the variables for the compression algorithms
# para0, para1, ... are the variables for the algorithm parameters
# flag0, flag1, ... are the variables for the flags
# labl0, labl1, ... are the variables for the label name (if you want some)
# uuid0, uuid1, ... are the variables for the UUID (if you want to force it)
# args0, args1, ... are the variables for additional arguments to zram-init
#                   (args0, args1, ... are eval'd, so quote correspondingly!)
# notr0, notr1, ... are the flags (nonempty = true) for "do not trim (discard)"
# (set notr* to a nonempty value only for linux-3.14 or earlier or when you
# are prepared to waste a lot of memory for a possibly slight speed increase)
#
# The following are ignored for type swap but not for the other types:
# blck0, blck1, ... are the variables for the blocksize (ext2, ext4)
# irat0, irat1, ... are the variables for the byte/inode ratio (ext2, ext4)
# inod0, inod1, ... are the variables for the inode number (ext2, ext4)
# opts0, opts1, ... are the variables for the mount options
# mode0, mode1, ... are the variables for the directory mode
# owgr0, owgr1, ... are the variables for the directory owner:group
#
# If the size is 0 (or empty) the device is ignored by the script.
#
# Available types:
# "swap"  The device is initialized as a swap device.
#         The flags variable specifies the priority (16383 if empty).
#         Use "-" in the flags variable for the default priority (-1)
# "/..."  The device is mounted on /...
#         The flags variable specifies the type (ext2, ext4, btrfs, or xfs;
#         default is ext4)
# "-"     The filesystem (specified by flags as above) is created in
#         /dev/zram$NUM but not mounted
# Devices with other types are ignored by the script
#
# Only variables with numbers  0 ... num_devices-1  are used by the script.
