A wrapper script for the zram linux kernel module with zsh and openrc support.

This is a small helper script to setup a zram device as swap or as a ramdisk.
Also a zsh-completion file and openrc init-scripts (used e.g. by gentoo)
are provided.

To install this script, just copy the content of sbin into root's $PATH.
To obtain support for zsh completion, copy the content of zsh to zsh's $fpath.
For openrc support, the content of openrc should go into /etc

For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the mv overlay (available by layman).
